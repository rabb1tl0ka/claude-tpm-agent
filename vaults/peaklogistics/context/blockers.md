## BLOCKER-001: Delivery Zones Logic Still in Shaping
- **Since**: Ongoing
- **Impact**: Last major V2 feature not in execution
- **Owner**: Marcus/Priya
- **Notes**: Three competing approaches: geo-fencing, postal codes, custom polygons. PeakLogistics needs to pick one. Technical feasibility confirmed for all three.

## BLOCKER-002: Driver Dashboard — Map SDK License
- **Since**: Feb 10
- **Impact**: Low — workaround exists using open-source Leaflet
- **Owner**: Nina
- **Notes**: Preferred map SDK (Mapbox) license renewal pending PL procurement. Can proceed with Leaflet and swap later.
