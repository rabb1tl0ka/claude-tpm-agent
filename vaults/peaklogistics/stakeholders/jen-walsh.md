# Jen Walsh - VP of Product, PeakLogistics

## Role
VP of Product (joined 3 months ago after Series Seed)

## Background
Former Senior Product Manager at a B2B SaaS company. 8 years experience building marketplace products. Joined PeakLogistics because she saw the massive market opportunity and liked Marcus + Sarah's vision. First product hire.

## Goals
What is Jen trying to achieve? What does success look like for her?

- **Nail the MVP user experience** - Suppliers and shippers need to "get it" immediately
- **Validate product-market fit** - Launch needs to prove people will actually use this
- **Define V2 roadmap** - V1 is just the start, need to know what comes next
- **Build feedback loops** - Instrument the product to learn from real user behavior
- **Balance stakeholder requests** - Marcus wants speed, Sarah wants quality, users want features

## Challenges / Pains
What obstacles, frustrations, or pain points is Jen dealing with? What keeps her up at night?

- **Minimal user research time** - 6 weeks doesn't leave room for extensive validation
- **Designing for two user types** - Suppliers and shippers have different mental models
- **Feature prioritization** - Pressure to add "just one more thing" before launch
- **No design team yet** - Loka is providing design, which is great, but adds coordination overhead
- **Uncertainty about user adoption** - Will they actually switch from their current (manual) process?

## Needs / Wants
What does Jen need from Loka?

- **UX design partnership** - Needs Loka designer to think through flows, not just execute mockups
- **Prototype or clickable designs** - Wants to validate flows before development starts
- **User feedback mechanisms** - Build in analytics, feedback buttons, usage tracking from day 1
- **Feature scope discipline** - Help push back on nice-to-haves that threaten timeline
- **Incremental delivery** - Show progress weekly so she can validate direction

## Communication Preferences
- **Prefers:** Figma comments for design feedback, Slack for quick questions, Zoom for planning
- **Cadence:** Weekly product sync, design reviews as needed
- **Style:** Collaborative, asks lots of "why" questions
- **Decision speed:** Deliberate on strategy, fast on tactics

## Notes
- User-centric, will advocate for user needs even if it slows things down
- Data-driven - wants to instrument everything to learn from usage
- Comfortable with MVPs - doesn't need perfection, needs validation
- Strong opinions on UX, open to technical constraints
- Will challenge feature requests that don't serve core user needs
- Appreciates when team brings product thinking, not just execution
