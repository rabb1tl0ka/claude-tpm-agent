# Sarah Chen - CTO, PeakLogistics

## Role
Chief Technology Officer and Co-founder

## Background
Former Principal Engineer at a major logistics tech company. Led the API platform team that powered integrations with hundreds of carriers. Deep technical expertise in marketplace platforms, API design, and logistics systems. Co-founded PeakLogistics with Marcus after seeing how fragmented the industry was.

## Goals
What is Sarah trying to achieve? What does success look like for her?

- **Build scalable, maintainable architecture** - This needs to support 10x growth post-launch
- **API-first design** - Web app is important, but the API is the long-term platform
- **Fast iteration cycles** - Ship weekly, learn from real usage, iterate
- **Quality without over-engineering** - V1 needs to work well, not be perfect
- **Strong data model** - Core entities (suppliers, shippers, containers, trips) must be solid from day 1

## Challenges / Pains
What obstacles, frustrations, or pain points is Sarah dealing with? What keeps her up at night?

- **Technical debt risk** - Moving fast can create debt that slows down V2, V3
- **Scope creep** - Pressure to add features that aren't critical for launch
- **Database design** - Core data model needs to be right, refactoring later is expensive
- **Authentication & security** - Handling real logistics data means security can't be an afterthought
- **Balancing speed vs quality** - How much testing is "enough" for a 6-week timeline?

## Needs / Wants
What does Sarah need from Loka?

- **API design review** - Wants to review endpoints, data models before implementation
- **Weekly technical sync** - Align on architecture decisions, not just status
- **Automation where possible** - CI/CD, testing, deployment - reduce manual overhead
- **Documentation as you go** - Not heavy docs, but API specs and data models documented
- **Escalation path for technical risks** - If something will break the timeline, she needs to know early

## Communication Preferences
- **Prefers:** Slack for day-to-day, Zoom for technical deep-dives
- **Cadence:** Weekly tech sync, daily async updates in Slack
- **Style:** Technical depth appreciated, but explain trade-offs clearly
- **Decision speed:** Thoughtful but decisive - will make the call once she has the data

## Notes
- Values technical excellence but pragmatic about MVPs
- Strong opinions on API design, open to input on implementation
- Appreciates when team proactively identifies risks
- Will challenge assumptions to ensure we're solving the right problem
- Empowered to make technical decisions without Marcus approval
- Expects detailed technical discussions, not just high-level summaries
