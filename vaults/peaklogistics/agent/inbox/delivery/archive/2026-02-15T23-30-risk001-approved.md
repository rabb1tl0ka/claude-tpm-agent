## RISK-001 Mitigation Plan Approved — Execution Handoff

**Context:**
RISK-001 (Auth delay: 2→4 days) mitigation plan has been approved by Bruno.

**Approved Mitigation:**
Hybrid approach — stub API + parallel work to recover timeline.

**Execution Plan (Week 2: Feb 17-21):**

1. **Monday Feb 17:**
   - Joao confirms stub auth API spec (basic JWT, no RBAC yet)
   - Zoran aligns on UI work against stubs

2. **Tuesday Feb 18 (EOD):**
   - Joao delivers stub auth API
   - Zoran starts React auth UI (login/signup) against stubs

3. **Tuesday-Thursday:**
   - Joao completes full RBAC backend in parallel
   - Zoran continues UI development

4. **Friday Feb 21:**
   - Integration testing (stub → full RBAC)
   - Demo: Working login/signup

**Fallback:**
If stub approach fails by Wednesday → absorb 2-day delay, use Week 6 buffer

## What I Need From You (Delivery Manager)

### Immediate (Monday Feb 17)
- [ ] Confirm with Joao: Can he deliver stub API by EOD Tuesday?
- [ ] Confirm with Zoran: Can he start UI work with stubs?
- [ ] Set up daily check-ins for Week 2 (monitor integration risk)

### Week 2 Daily Monitoring
- **Monday:** Stub API spec confirmed
- **Tuesday:** Stub API delivered (critical milestone)
- **Wednesday:** Zoran progress on UI (escalation trigger if stub failed)
- **Thursday:** RBAC backend complete
- **Friday:** Integration + demo

### Escalation Trigger
- If stub approach fails by **Wednesday Feb 19**, escalate to Bruno for scope decision (Option 2: simplify RBAC)
