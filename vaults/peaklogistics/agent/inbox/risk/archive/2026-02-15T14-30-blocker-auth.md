**Blocker identified:**

Joao (Backend Lead) reports that the user authentication implementation is more complex than estimated. JWT token management, session handling, and role-based access control (supplier vs shipper) is taking 2x longer than estimated.

Originally: 2 days (per scope.md)
Now: likely 4 days

**Impact:**
- Timeline: Pushes Week 2 milestone "User sign-up/login working" by 2 days
- Dependencies: Blocks all user-specific features (posting shipments/trips)
- Critical path: Authentication is a prerequisite for everything else

**Request:**
Assess this as a risk and recommend mitigation.
