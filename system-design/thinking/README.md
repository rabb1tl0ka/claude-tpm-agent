# Thinking

Active brainstorming, exploration, and open questions. This is the collaborative space where Bruno and Claude work through ideas before they become decisions or architecture docs.

## What Goes Here

- Exploratory questions and research
- Rough drafts of architectural ideas
- Tradeoff analyses in progress
- "What if..." scenarios
- Improvement ideas (prefix with `IDEA-`)

## What Doesn't Go Here

- Finalized decisions → Move to `decisions/`
- Implemented architecture → Move to `architecture/`
- Code experiments → Create branches or use temp files

## Filename Conventions

- `RAW-` prefix — 100% human-authored. Bruno's raw thinking, no LLM involved.
- `IDEA-` prefix — Improvement proposals or feature ideas.
- No prefix — Standard notes (check `author:` metadata for authorship details).

## Authorship

All files follow the authorship convention defined in CLAUDE.md:

| Author value | Meaning |
|-------------|---------|
| `author: Bruno` | Bruno sole author. Always paired with `RAW-` prefix. |
| `author: Bruno (main), Claude` | Bruno's original work, Claude enhanced it. |
| `author: Claude (main), Bruno` | Claude's work, Bruno added his own thinking. |
| `author: Claude` | Claude sole author, even if Bruno prompted it. |

Prompting Claude to research or write something does not make Bruno a co-author. Co-authorship requires adding your own thinking, opinions, research, or writing.
