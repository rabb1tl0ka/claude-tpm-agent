# Architecture

Finalized architectural designs for the TPM AI Agent system.

## What Goes Here

- Accepted architecture documents that describe how the system is built
- System diagrams and component breakdowns
- Migration plans between architectural versions

## What Doesn't Go Here

- Ideas still being explored → `thinking/`
- Decision records explaining *why* we chose something → `decisions/`

## Naming Convention

- `poc-v2-role-based-architecture.md` — Specific architecture version
- `mvp-production-ready.md` — Stage-specific design
- `comparison-cron-vs-webhooks.md` — Tradeoff analysis between approaches
